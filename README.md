# RetroFW-Windows98
Windows 98 Theme made for systems with RetroFW

Intro
------------
Made this theme as soon as I got the LDK Landscape. It's an awesome device and the layout suites it well. Icons are custom size for this theme based off of the selection square size so they may not work properly with other themes. Wallpapers should work for any other theme however, just watch for the "section" icons.

Installation
------------
- Copy folder "Windows98" to skins folder (e.g. RetroFW/apps/gmenu2x/skins/)
- Restart device and go to skin setting and change to "Windows98"
- Done! There are some alternate wallpapers rather than just the green window
